							<h1>Eventica Privacy</h1>
							<p><i>Updated June 2015</i></p>

							<p align="justify">CEventica, Inc. (<b>"Eventica"</b>, <b>"our"</b>, <b>"us"</b> or <b>"we"</b>) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of our website located at [Eventica.com] (the <b>"Site"</b>), services, features and content (collectively, the <b>"Eventica Platform"</b>). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Eventica Platform. A user of the Eventica Platform, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user, is hereinafter referred to as a <b>"User"</b>, or collectively, the <b>"Users"</b>.</p>

							<p align="justify">This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time at our discretion. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Eventica [Terms of Service]. Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined will have the definitions provided in the Terms of Service. As used in this policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include using Cookies (defined below) on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among affiliates or partners we establish.</p>

							<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
							<p align="justify">We collect, use and process information via the Eventica Platform to improve and further develop the Eventica Platform and to enable and facilitate Users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site.</p>

							<h2>Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
							<p align="justify">In the course of using the Eventica Platform (whether as a Client or Freelancer), we may ask you to provide us with, or grant us access to, or permission to obtain, certain personally identifiable information that may be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your name, company name, email address, postal address, work experience and interests, and phone number(s) and other personal information, expressly including all User Content provided by you (hereafter <b>"PersonalÂ Information"</b>).</p>

							<p align="justify">If you use the Eventica Platform to make or receive payments, we may also collect certain Personal Information such as financial account information and/or billing address(es).</p>

							<p align="justify">We may collect additional Personal Information to validate your identity, such as your date of birth, place of birth or taxpayer identification number. We may request documents to verify this information, such as a copy of your government-issued identification or photo, and we may authenticate it against third party databases.</p>

							<p align="justify">As further described in our [Terms of Service], you may register or input data through the Eventica Platform directly via the Site or by logging into your account with certain third party social networking services (hereafter <b>"SNS"</b>), including, but not limited to, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google etc., via our Site. If you choose to input data via an SNS, we will use the Personal Information you have provided to the SNS (such as your "real" name, email address, gender, prior experience and other information you make publicly available via the SNS) to modify and update your account. The information we extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS. Other than what may be shared with the SNS, as described below, the Personal Information a SNS has about you is obtained by the SNS independent of the Eventica Platform, and Eventica is not responsible for such information's accuracy, legality, or non-infringement.</p>

							<p align="justify">You may link your Eventica account to your SNS account, in which case the SNS may share certain information about you with other SNS users, as well as sharing certain information about other SNS users with you. You represent that you are authorized to use your SNS account for the purposes described herein without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern the SNS, and without obligating Eventica to pay any fees or making Eventica subject to any usage limitations imposed by such SNS. You can disable the link between your Eventica account and your SNS account at any time though the "Settings" section of the Site. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ANY SNS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH SNS. If your SNS account terminates, then functions enabled through the link between your Eventica account and your SNS account will terminate as well.</p>
							<p align="justify">We also collect other information that you provide in connection with your use of the Eventica Platform (e.g., zip code (on its own) and individual preferences) (<b>"Non-Identifying Information"</b>). We collect additional Non-Identifying Information from Clients in the form of information related to Projects posted via the Eventica Platform (e.g., pricing, location, history of Project postings, timing of Project performance and feedback/rating information). We also collect additional Non-Identifying Information from Freelancers in connection with Freelancer profiles (e.g., information on Projects previously performed, skills, tests taken, compensation rates and feedback/rating information)</p>.

							<p align="justify">We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) to, among other things, provide the Eventica Platform, facilitate your transactions and administer your inquiries.</p>

							<p align="justify">Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Eventica Platform, to analyze and understand how our Site and Eventica Platform are used, and to generate general industry analysis. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance by offering a product or service to you according to your preferences or restrictions.</p>

							<p align="justify">When you register for the Eventica Platform, you will be opting-in to receive Eventica notification emails, newsletters, marketing and/or promotional materials. We will also use your Personal Information to send this content to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, you can opt-out or customize the type of messages you receive from Eventica by visiting the "Notifications" section under "Account Settings", or by clicking on the unsubscribe link included at the bottom of Eventica emails, or by emailing us at info@Eventica.com. Please note that any such opt-out applies solely to marketing related emails. Eventica will still need to communicate with you via notifications regarding non-marketing related matters related to the Eventica Platform and you acknowledge and agree that Eventica has the right to do so.</p>

							<h2>Eventica's Use of Personal Information</h2>

							<p align="justify">Eventica may use Personal Information for the following general purposes:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>To provide, manage and maintain the Eventica Platform;</li>

								<li>To analyze Site usage and improve the Eventica Platform;</li>
								<li>To contact you and deliver administrative notices and communications relevant to your use of the Eventica Platform;</li>

							</ul>
							<p align="justify">We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate the Eventica Platform on our behalf, to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing, fraud detection and improvement of the Eventica Platform's features) or to assist us in analyzing how the Eventica Platform is used. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. Although we ensure that our third party agents (<b>"Agents"</b>) receiving your information are bound by confidentiality obligations, Eventica is not responsible for and shall not be liable for any issues that may arise regarding the Privacy Policies of any of its agents, affiliates, advertiser and/or any other third parties. By using this website, you do hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Eventica from any claims and/or damages that may arise from the actions or inactions of any of Eventica's Agents, partners, affiliates and/or advertisers.</p>

							<p align="justify">Ads are a standard part of user experience on the Internet, and Eventica believes that targeted advertising enhances this experience. Eventica may use Cookies (defined below) and other technologies and Personal Information to place ads where they believe interested parties will see them. In addition to banner ads, Eventica may advertise products, companies and events that we think might interest you through the email address you provide.</p>

							<p align="justify">Eventica may analyze Personal Information and Web Navigational Data based on your interests and may use the analysis from this information in a way that does not contain any Personal Information (<b>"Market Research"</b>) in order to market the Eventica Platform and increase the likelihood that a User's experience with the Eventica Platform is relevant to such User's interests. Eventica uses data at the individual level to sell products and services to Users who express an interest in these products and services, through a poll for example, or to Users who can be presumed to have an interest based on results from our Market Research.</p>
							
							<p align="justify">Eventica may use your cell phone number to call or text you in order to provide the Eventica Platform. If you would like more information about our policy, or to opt out, please review our Terms of Service, available at Eventica.com/terms and email info@Eventica.com; by accepting the Terms of Service you are indicating your consent to be contacted at the phone number you have provided for the purposes described above.</p>

							<h2>Information Sharing</h2>
							<p align="justify">When you submit information to Eventica, it is collected, processed and maintained solely by us or by third party Agents who are bound by confidentiality obligations. If you would like to opt out from the onward transfer of your information to our non-agent partners, you may send us an email at info@Eventica.com. Include the word "privacy" in the subject line of the email and all your registration information in the body of the email.</p>

							<p align="justify">We may share or otherwise use aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and log data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.</p>

							<p align="justify">Partners may sponsor promotions, contests and sweepstakes that require you to reveal details such as your name, address or phone number. When a Partner-sponsored contest or sweepstakes is made available through the Eventica Platform, it will contain a link to the Partner's privacy policy. Always check their privacy policy before revealing information about yourself. If you do not want these sponsors to have your Personal Information, you can choose to not participate in their contests, sweepstakes and other offerings.</p>

							<p align="justify">Eventica reserves the right to utilize and disclose Personal Information from the Eventica Platform at our discretion, if required by law or if we are given reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary in order to prevent harm to the Eventica Platform or our Users or to protect the rights of our Users, the general public, or Eventica, or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process.</p>

							<p align="justify">Finally, Eventica reserves the right to transfer, sell and/or distribute all information collected through the Eventica Platform to an affiliate, subsidiary, or third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or part of our business, assets or stock. We will require that any new entity follows this Privacy Policy with respect to your Personal Information, as and to the extent required by applicable law, unless and until you consent to a different privacy policy of the new entity.</p>

							<h2>Client-Freelancer Communication and Project Work Product</h2>
							<p align="justify">As part of the Eventica Platform, we may collect information and communications transferred between Client and Freelancer. Such data may include information input, sent or delivered by the Freelancer or Client such as a memo, Project details, Project timeline, Project pricing, and responses to queries. Eventica may use this information for statistical analysis, product development, marketing and research. Except as noted above, we do not treat information contained in these communications as Personal Information, but we may use such information in association with Personal Information, and we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.</p>

							<h2>Log Data</h2>
							<p align="justify">When you visit the Site as a User, whether as a registered User or a non-registered User, and whether from a desktop or mobile device, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (<b>"Log Data"</b>).

In addition, we may use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this type of information in order to increase our Site's functionality and user-friendliness, to better tailor it to our visitors' needs, and to detect suspicious activity. These third party service providers have their own privacy policies addressing how they use such information. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information, but we may use it in connection with Personal Information, and we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such Log Data for the same purposes as stated above regarding Non-Identifying Information.</p>

							<h2>Cookies</h2>
							<p align="justify">Like many websites, we use <b>"Cookies"</b>, a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes, to collect information.
